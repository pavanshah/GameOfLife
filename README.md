# Conway's Game Of Life

## What is Conway's Game Of Life?</br>
Conway's game of life is a cellular evolution game. It creates certain cellular patterns based on different rules.</br>
It works on following rules -</br>
1] Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</br>
2] Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</br>
3] Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</br>
4] Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</br>
